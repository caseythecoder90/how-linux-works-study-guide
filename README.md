## Chapter Template Structure

Each chapter follows this standard structure:

### Files
- **README.md** - Chapter overview and learning objectives
- **notes.md** - Comprehensive notes covering all topics
- **flashcards.md** - Question/answer pairs for active recall
- **cheatsheet.md** - Quick reference for commands and concepts

### Directories
- **examples/** - Practical code examples and configurations
- **exercises/** - Lab exercises and practice problems

## Study Methodology

### 1. Active Learning
- Take detailed notes in your own words
- Create practical examples for every concept
- Practice commands in a lab environment
- Build real projects using learned concepts

### 2. Spaced Repetition
- Use flashcards for key concepts and commands
- Review previous chapters regularly
- Progressive difficulty in exercises
- Track which topics need more practice

### 3. Hands-on Practice
- Set up virtual machines for testing
- Complete all lab exercises
- Practice troubleshooting scenarios
- Document your own discoveries

### 4. Teaching Others
- Explain concepts to others
- Create your own examples
- Write summaries in your own words
- Help others in study groups

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd how-linux-works-study-guide
   ```

2. **Set up your lab environment**
   - Install VirtualBox or VMware
   - Create Linux VMs for practice
   - Set up SSH access between machines

3. **Start with Chapter 1**
   - Read the chapter overview
   - Follow the study schedule
   - Complete all exercises

4. **Track your progress**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/study-progress.sh
   ```

## File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `system-configuration.md`
- Prefix exercises with numbers: `01-basic-setup.md`
- Group related files in subdirectories
- Use descriptive names for examples

## Available Scripts

### Creating New Chapters
```bash
./scripts/new-chapter.sh 08 "Processes and Jobs"
```

### Tracking Progress
```bash
./scripts/study-progress.sh
```

## Study Schedule

### Recommended Weekly Plan
- **Monday**: New chapter reading (1-2 hours)
- **Tuesday**: Notes and examples (1 hour)
- **Wednesday**: Flashcard creation and review (45 minutes)
- **Thursday**: Lab exercises (1-2 hours)
- **Friday**: Review and cheatsheet creation (45 minutes)
- **Saturday**: Previous chapter review (30 minutes)
- **Sunday**: Flashcard review and planning (30 minutes)

### Daily Minimum
- **15 minutes**: Flashcard review
- **30 minutes**: Reading or practice
- **Total**: 45 minutes per day

See `progress/study-schedule.md` for detailed planning.

## Flashcard System

### Organization
- **all-cards.md** - Master collection of all flashcards
- **by-topic/** - Cards organized by subject (logging, networking, etc.)
- **spaced-repetition/** - Cards scheduled for review

### Usage
- Review new cards daily for the first week
- Graduate to spaced intervals (2 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month)
- Focus extra attention on difficult cards
- Create new cards for challenging concepts

## Quick Reference Materials

The `quick-reference/` directory contains:
- Command reference sheets
- Important file locations
- Troubleshooting guides
- Emergency procedures

## Practice Labs

Virtual lab exercises in `practice-labs/`:
- VM setup instructions
- Hands-on scenarios for each chapter
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Real-world applications

## Progress Tracking

### Files in `progress/`
- **study-schedule.md** - Personal study timeline
- **completed-chapters.md** - Chapter completion tracking
- **review-log.md** - Review session notes
- **goals.md** - Learning objectives and milestones

### Automated Tracking
Run `./scripts/study-progress.sh` to see:
- Completion percentages
- Chapters with content
- Next steps recommendations

## Chapter 7 Status: COMPLETED ✅

Chapter 7 (System Configuration) is fully populated with:
- ✅ Comprehensive notes covering logging, users, time, scheduling, and PAM
- ✅ 50 flashcards for key concepts and commands
- ✅ Practical examples and shell scripts
- ✅ Complete lab exercise with 8 parts
- ✅ All topics from the book covered in detail

## Tools and Setup

### Required Tools
- Linux system (VM or native installation)
- Text editor (VS Code, vim, nano, etc.)
- Git for version control
- Terminal multiplexer (tmux/screen) - recommended

### Recommended Setup
- VirtualBox or VMware for lab VMs
- Multiple Linux distributions for testing
- SSH keys for secure access
- Backup system for important work

## Study Tips

### Effective Note-Taking
- Use your own words, not just copy-paste
- Include practical examples for every concept
- Test all commands before documenting
- Add troubleshooting tips from experience

### Flashcard Best Practices
- Keep questions specific and focused
- Include context in answers
- Create cards for commands, concepts, and file locations
- Review regularly and consistently

### Lab Practice
- Always practice in a safe environment
- Document what you learn from mistakes
- Try variations of exercises
- Build progressively complex scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Git conflicts**: Use `git stash` before pulling updates
- **Permission errors**: Check file permissions and ownership
- **Script errors**: Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x`)

### Getting Help
- Check the troubleshooting guides in `quick-reference/`
- Review related chapters for background
- Practice in a clean VM environment
- Document solutions for future reference
