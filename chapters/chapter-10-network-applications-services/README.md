# Chapter 10: Network Applications and Services

## Overview
This chapter explores network applications running in user space at the application layerâ€”the clients and servers that provide the network services we use daily. You'll learn how network clients connect to servers, understand common network protocols, and discover tools for debugging and monitoring network services.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- [ ] Understand the client-server model for network applications
- [ ] Use telnet and curl to interact with network services
- [ ] Configure and manage network servers (SSH, web servers, etc.)
- [ ] Diagnose network issues using lsof, tcpdump, and netcat
- [ ] Understand network security fundamentals
- [ ] Work with sockets and network programming concepts
- [ ] Implement basic network security measures

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of TCP/IP networking (Chapter 9)
- Knowledge of processes and services
- Basic understanding of system administration
- Familiarity with command-line tools

## Key Concepts
- **Client-Server Model**: Applications that request services vs. applications that provide services
- **Network Protocols**: HTTP, SSH, FTP, and other application-layer protocols
- **Port Numbers**: Standardized endpoints for network services
- **Network Servers**: Daemon processes that listen for network connections
- **Network Security**: Authentication, encryption, and access control
- **Network Diagnostics**: Tools and techniques for troubleshooting network services
- **Sockets**: Programming interfaces for network communication

- **flashcards.md**: Key terms and concepts for review
- **examples/**: Practical configurations and command examples
- **exercises/**: Lab exercises and practice problems
- **cheatsheet.md**: Quick reference for commands and concepts

## Estimated Study Time
- **Reading**: 3 hours

## Files and Directories Covered
Key system files and directories discussed in this chapter:
- `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` - SSH server configuration
- `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` - SSH client configuration
- `/etc/hosts` - Local hostname resolution
- `/etc/services` - Port number assignments
- `/var/log/auth.log` - Authentication logs
- `/proc/net/tcp` - Active TCP connections
- `~/.ssh/` - User SSH configuration and keys

## Important Commands
Essential commands introduced in this chapter:
- `telnet` - Connect to network services for testing
- `curl` - HTTP client with debugging capabilities
- `ssh` - Secure shell client
- `scp` - Secure copy over network
- `sftp` - Secure file transfer protocol
- `lsof` - List open files and network connections
- `tcpdump` - Capture and analyze network packets
- `netcat` - Network connection utility
- `nmap` - Network port scanner
- `netstat` - Display network connections and statistics
